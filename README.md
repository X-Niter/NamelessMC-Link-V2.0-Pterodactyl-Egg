# NamelessMC-Link-V2.0-Pterodactyl-Egg
This is a Pterodactyl Panel Egg for the NamelessMC Link Bot version 2.0.
I took this from the original auther and converted the variables to work with PostgreSQL.
You can most likely still use this and define "stateless" in the storage type! 

This can be used by anyone but please keep in mind that this Pterodactyl Egg is set up in the assumption that you have already set up a postgresql database with the proper tables.
